= webfaces

webfaces is a library that helps you build JavaServer Faces components using Web Components.

== Background

JavaServer Faces (JSF) is the standard API for building Java web applications (part of the Java Enterprise Edition,
or Java EE) specification. A key part of JSF applications is a sever-side user interface component model. JSF pages ("views")
are built out of smaller UI components. For examples, see the PrimeFaces showcase.

Web Components is a collection of relatively new HTML5 standards that bring a native component model to HTML, with a
full-fledged JavaScript API. Since the standard is integrated into browsers, it allows you to build reusable components
that work like ordinary HTML tags. Web Components is not tied to any specific JavaScript framework. For examples of Web Components,
see http://webcomponents.org[webcomponents.org^].

JSF components often expose both a server-side Java API and a client-side JavaScript API. Usually the client-side APIs are built
with proprietary frameworks and libraries such as a jQuery. However, Web Components are particularly well suited for
for exposing the client-side API. Such components provide a more consistent, standard approach for client-side integration and
are more likely to work with third-party JavaScript web frameworks.

For more information about how these two component models compare, see the presentation http://virtua.tech/slides/webcomponents-jsf/[Web Components and JavaServer Faces: Synergy?^].

== Sample Applications

There are two separate sample applications available which make use of this library. Take a look at these apps to see how to
use the webfaces to build JSF components with Web Components APIs:
